In the absence of an organized marketing structure, private traders and middlemen dominate the marketing and trading of agricultural products.
The remuneration of the services provided by the middlemen increases the load on the consumer, although the producer does not derive similar benefit.Many market surveys have revealed that middlemen take away about 48 per cent of the price of rice,52 per cent of the price of groundnuts and 60 per cent of the price of potatoes offered by consumers.There is also no fixed price categories of the products. Like fixed price for vegetables, dairy, fruits and so on.Farmers are forced to sell their agricultural products in a cheap and easy rates which are later multipled by the middle agents,which are then sold to the markets in an excessive price ranges.They don't get good return on sales.</p>
